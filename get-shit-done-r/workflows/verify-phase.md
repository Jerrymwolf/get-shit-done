<purpose>
Verify phase goal achievement through goal-backward analysis. Check that the codebase delivers what the phase promised, not just that tasks completed.

Executed by a verification subagent spawned from execute-phase.md.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
**Task completion ≠ Goal achievement**

A task "create chat component" can be marked complete when the component is a placeholder. The task was done — but the goal "working chat interface" was not achieved.

Goal-backward verification:
1. What must be TRUE for the goal to be achieved?
2. What must EXIST for those truths to hold?
3. What must be WIRED for those artifacts to function?

Then verify each level against the actual codebase.

<step name="load_context" priority="first">
Load phase operation context:

```bash
INIT=$(node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" init phase-op "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Extract from init JSON: `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `has_plans`, `plan_count`.

Then load phase details and list plans/summaries:
```bash
node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" roadmap get-phase "${phase_number}"
grep -E "^| ${phase_number}" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SUMMARY.md "$phase_dir"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract **phase goal** from ROADMAP.md (the outcome to verify, not tasks) and **requirements** from REQUIREMENTS.md if it exists.
</step>

<step name="detect_research_phase">
**Detect if this is a research phase** before establishing must-haves.

```bash
# Check for -sources/ directories (research note source folders)
find "$PHASE_DIR" -name "*-sources" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Check for note files with research frontmatter (domain: field)
grep -rl "^domain:" "$PHASE_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v PLAN | grep -v SUMMARY | grep -v CONTEXT | grep -v VERIFICATION | grep -v RESEARCH | grep -v VALIDATION | grep -v UAT
```

Set `is_research_phase = true` if either check finds results.

**If `is_research_phase` is true:**

1. Collect research note paths and their associated `-sources/` directories
2. For each note, extract the research question from:
   - The note's frontmatter (`question:` field)
   - The corresponding PLAN.md task descriptions
   - The note's title and domain (fallback)
3. Store as `research_notes[]` array: `{ notePath, sourcesDir, sourceLogPath, researchQuestion }`

This context will be passed to the gsd-r-verifier agent in the verify step so it can run research-specific two-tier verification using `verify-research.cjs`.

**If `is_research_phase` is false:** Continue normally -- standard code verification only.
</step>

<step name="establish_must_haves">
**Option A: Must-haves in PLAN frontmatter**

Use gsd-tools to extract must_haves from each PLAN:

```bash
for plan in "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md; do
  MUST_HAVES=$(node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" frontmatter get "$plan" --field must_haves)
  echo "=== $plan ===" && echo "$MUST_HAVES"
done
```

Returns JSON: `{ truths: [...], artifacts: [...], key_links: [...] }`

Aggregate all must_haves across plans for phase-level verification.

**Option B: Use Success Criteria from ROADMAP.md**

If no must_haves in frontmatter (MUST_HAVES returns error or empty), check for Success Criteria:

```bash
PHASE_DATA=$(node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" roadmap get-phase "${phase_number}" --raw)
```

Parse the `success_criteria` array from the JSON output. If non-empty:
1. Use each Success Criterion directly as a **truth** (they are already written as observable, testable behaviors)
2. Derive **artifacts** (concrete file paths for each truth)
3. Derive **key links** (critical wiring where stubs hide)
4. Document the must-haves before proceeding

Success Criteria from ROADMAP.md are the contract — they override PLAN-level must_haves when both exist.

**Option C: Derive from phase goal (fallback)**

If no must_haves in frontmatter AND no Success Criteria in ROADMAP:
1. State the goal from ROADMAP.md
2. Derive **truths** (3-7 observable behaviors, each testable)
3. Derive **artifacts** (concrete file paths for each truth)
4. Derive **key links** (critical wiring where stubs hide)
5. Document derived must-haves before proceeding
</step>

<step name="verify_truths">
For each observable truth, determine if the codebase enables it.

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED (all supporting artifacts pass) | ✗ FAILED (artifact missing/stub/unwired) | ? UNCERTAIN (needs human)

For each truth: identify supporting artifacts → check artifact status → check wiring → determine truth status.

**Example:** Truth "User can see existing messages" depends on Chat.tsx (renders), /api/chat GET (provides), Message model (schema). If Chat.tsx is a stub or API returns hardcoded [] → FAILED. If all exist, are substantive, and connected → VERIFIED.

**Research phase additional context:** When `is_research_phase` is true, the verifier agent also receives:

1. **Research verification module reference:** `get-shit-done-r/bin/lib/verify-research.cjs`
2. **Research verification criteria:** `get-shit-done-r/references/research-verification.md`
3. **Research note inventory:** The `research_notes[]` array from `detect_research_phase` step, containing:
   - Note file paths and their `-sources/` directories
   - SOURCE-LOG.md locations
   - Research questions (from plan context or note frontmatter)

The verifier uses `verifyNote()` for two-tier checks and `generateFixTasks()` on failure. Fix task descriptions are included in the gaps section and can be passed to `/gsd-r:quick` for execution.

This is ADDITIVE -- standard goal-backward verification (Steps 3-6) still runs for all phases. Research verification (Step 6.5 in the agent) adds research-specific checks on top.
</step>

<step name="verify_artifacts">
Use gsd-tools for artifact verification against must_haves in each PLAN:

```bash
for plan in "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md; do
  ARTIFACT_RESULT=$(node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" verify artifacts "$plan")
  echo "=== $plan ===" && echo "$ARTIFACT_RESULT"
done
```

Parse JSON result: `{ all_passed, passed, total, artifacts: [{path, exists, issues, passed}] }`

**Artifact status from result:**
- `exists=false` → MISSING
- `issues` not empty → STUB (check issues for "Only N lines" or "Missing pattern")
- `passed=true` → VERIFIED (Levels 1-2 pass)

**Level 3 — Wired (manual check for artifacts that pass Levels 1-2):**
```bash
grep -r "import.*$artifact_name" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"  # IMPORTED
grep -r "$artifact_name" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "import"  # USED
```
WIRED = imported AND used. ORPHANED = exists but not imported/used.

| Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ VERIFIED |
| ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ⚠️ ORPHANED |
| ✓ | ✗ | - | ✗ STUB |
| ✗ | - | - | ✗ MISSING |
</step>

<step name="verify_wiring">
Use gsd-tools for key link verification against must_haves in each PLAN:

```bash
for plan in "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md; do
  LINKS_RESULT=$(node "/Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/bin/gsd-r-tools.cjs" verify key-links "$plan")
  echo "=== $plan ===" && echo "$LINKS_RESULT"
done
```

Parse JSON result: `{ all_verified, verified, total, links: [{from, to, via, verified, detail}] }`

**Link status from result:**
- `verified=true` → WIRED
- `verified=false` with "not found" → NOT_WIRED
- `verified=false` with "Pattern not found" → PARTIAL

**Fallback patterns (if key_links not in must_haves):**

| Pattern | Check | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Component → API | fetch/axios call to API path, response used (await/.then/setState) | WIRED / PARTIAL (call but unused response) / NOT_WIRED |
| API → Database | Prisma/DB query on model, result returned via res.json() | WIRED / PARTIAL (query but not returned) / NOT_WIRED |
| Form → Handler | onSubmit with real implementation (fetch/axios/mutate/dispatch), not console.log/empty | WIRED / STUB (log-only/empty) / NOT_WIRED |
| State → Render | useState variable appears in JSX (`{stateVar}` or `{stateVar.property}`) | WIRED / NOT_WIRED |

Record status and evidence for each key link.
</step>

<step name="verify_requirements">
If REQUIREMENTS.md exists:
```bash
grep -E "Phase ${PHASE_NUM}" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

For each requirement: parse description → identify supporting truths/artifacts → status: ✓ SATISFIED / ✗ BLOCKED / ? NEEDS HUMAN.
</step>

<step name="scan_antipatterns">
Extract files modified in this phase from SUMMARY.md, scan each:

| Pattern | Search | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK | `grep -n -E "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|HACK"` | ⚠️ Warning |
| Placeholder content | `grep -n -iE "placeholder\|coming soon\|will be here"` | 🛑 Blocker |
| Empty returns | `grep -n -E "return null\|return \{\}\|return \[\]\|=> \{\}"` | ⚠️ Warning |
| Log-only functions | Functions containing only console.log | ⚠️ Warning |

Categorize: 🛑 Blocker (prevents goal) | ⚠️ Warning (incomplete) | ℹ️ Info (notable).
</step>

<step name="identify_human_verification">
**Always needs human:** Visual appearance, user flow completion, real-time behavior (WebSocket/SSE), external service integration, performance feel, error message clarity.

**Needs human if uncertain:** Complex wiring grep can't trace, dynamic state-dependent behavior, edge cases.

Format each as: Test Name → What to do → Expected result → Why can't verify programmatically.
</step>

<step name="determine_status">
**passed:** All truths VERIFIED, all artifacts pass levels 1-3, all key links WIRED, no blocker anti-patterns.

**gaps_found:** Any truth FAILED, artifact MISSING/STUB, key link NOT_WIRED, or blocker found.

**human_needed:** All automated checks pass but human verification items remain.

**Score:** `verified_truths / total_truths`
</step>

<step name="generate_fix_plans">
If gaps_found:

1. **Cluster related gaps:** API stub + component unwired → "Wire frontend to backend". Multiple missing → "Complete core implementation". Wiring only → "Connect existing components".

2. **Generate plan per cluster:** Objective, 2-3 tasks (files/action/verify each), re-verify step. Keep focused: single concern per plan.

3. **Order by dependency:** Fix missing → fix stubs → fix wiring → verify.
</step>

<step name="create_report">
```bash
REPORT_PATH="$PHASE_DIR/${PHASE_NUM}-VERIFICATION.md"
```

Fill template sections: frontmatter (phase/timestamp/status/score), goal achievement, artifact table, wiring table, requirements coverage, anti-patterns, human verification, gaps summary, fix plans (if gaps_found), metadata.

See /Users/jeremiahwolf/.claude/get-shit-done-r/templates/verification-report.md for complete template.
</step>

<step name="return_to_orchestrator">
Return status (`passed` | `gaps_found` | `human_needed`), score (N/M must-haves), report path.

If gaps_found: list gaps + recommended fix plan names.
If human_needed: list items requiring human testing.

Orchestrator routes: `passed` → update_roadmap | `gaps_found` → create/execute fixes, re-verify | `human_needed` → present to user.
